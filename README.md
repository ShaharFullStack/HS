# HandSynth


HandSynth is an interactive web-based musical instrument that allows you to create music with your hands in 3D space. Using your webcam and hand tracking technology, HandSynth translates your hand movements into real-time synthesized sounds and mesmerizing visuals.

## 🎵 Features

- **Gesture-Based Music Creation**: Control melodies with your right hand and chords with your left hand
- **Immersive Visualizations**: Interactive particle system that responds to your music
- **Multiple Sound Presets**: Choose from synth, bell, pad, pluck, and piano sounds
- **Music Theory Integration**: Play in different scales including major, minor, pentatonic, and blues
- **Expressive Control**: Pinch gestures to control volume and dynamics
- **Virtual Keyboard Display**: Visual feedback of notes and chords being played
- **Multiple Visual Themes**: Choose between Classic, Cosmic and Minimal interfaces

## 🔍 Implementation Details

HandSynth uses several key technologies working together:

1. **Hand Tracking** via MediaPipe:
   - Tracks hand landmarks in real-time
   - Detects gestures like pinching
   - Maps Y-position to musical notes and chords

2. **Audio Synthesis** via Tone.js:
   - Generates synthesized sounds in real-time
   - Processes audio with effects like reverb and compression
   - Manages multiple synthesizer voices for polyphony

3. **Visual Feedback** via Three.js:
   - Creates responsive particle systems
   - Visualizes musical notes and chords
   - Provides immersive visual experience synchronized to music
